    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This is a text labeling tool prototype showing basic abilities of nlp frameworks which could be used for automated text annotation.</p>
    <p>Backend of the application is built on python with the help of
        <a href="https://spacy.io">spaCy</a> - Natural Language Processing framework and
        <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com">flask</a> - micro web framework
    </p>
    <p>Frontend layout is made with <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">https://getbootstrap.com</a> CSS framework,
        interaction with api for text labeling is performed via AJAX requests</p>

    <h4>Annotation types:</h4>
    <h5>Named Entity Recognition (NER)</h5>
    <p>
        NER is a subtask of natural language processing (NLP) that focuses on identifying and
        classifying
        named entities mentioned in unstructured text into predefined categories. Named entities are real-world objects
        that
        have proper names, such as:
    <ul>
        <li>Organizations: Names of companies, institutions, or groups (e.g., "Google," "United Nations")</li>
        <li>Locations: Geographical locations, such as countries, cities, and landmarks (e.g., "Paris," "Mount Everest")
        </li>
        <li>Dates and Times: Specific dates, times, or durations (e.g., "January 1, 2024," "two hours")</li>
        <li>Monetary Values: References to currency amounts (e.g., "$100," "â‚¬500")</li>
        <li>Persons: Names of people (e.g., "Albert Einstein," "Marie Curie")</li>
        <li>Percentages: Percentage values mentioned in the text (e.g., "20% growth")</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Linguistic annotations</h5>
    <p>These annotations are crucial for natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics because
        they help in understanding, processing, and analyzing language at various levels, such as syntax, semantics,
        phonetics, and more.</p>
    <p>Linguistic annotations can range from simple labels indicating parts of speech to complex structures representing
        syntactic or semantic relationships.</p>
